=head1 NAME

POE::Framework::MIDI::Key - Lexicon of key types

=head1 ABSTRACT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a lexicon of key types (major, minor, etc) and 
an interval key for building them from a root note.  For example: 
consider a piano keyboard.  The space from any note to its next 
nearest neighbour might be a black key or a white key.  That's a 
semitone.  Two semitones, or the key next to the key's nearest 
neighbour is a Tone (or "Full Tone"). If you start on any key, and 
count up one semitone at a time, you get an ascending chromatic (play 
every semitone) scale.  If you count "Tone, Tone, Semitone, Tone, 
Tone, Tone, Semitone" from the starting note, you get a major scale. 
This module aims to provide easy calculations for things like "What's 
the third note in a major scale starting with C#?"

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $key = new POE::Framework::MIDI::Key({
      name => 'maj',
      root => 'E4'
  });

  print 'The third of the scale is ',
      ${$key->numeric_scale}[2], "\n";
