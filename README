NAME

POE::Framework::MIDI - Algorithmic MIDI composition using POE

DESCRIPTION

POE::Framework::MIDI is a suite of modules which aim to provide a 
generalized framework for writing programs to algorithmically 
generate MIDI music using Perl and POE.

The Conductor object creates Musician objects which generate MIDI 
event streams and run them through rules and transformations.  The 
Conductor then renders the events down to perl code that MIDI::Simple 
can handle, and then runs that code to write a .mid file.

You can find example code in the distribution eg/ directory and at
http://justsomeguy.com/code/POE/POE-Framework-MIDI/examples/
