Revision history for Perl extension POE::Framework::MIDI.

0.1  - Original release to CPAN - pretty crufty.

0.2  Sun May 25 2003
    - Cleaned up POD.
    - Restructured distribution files.
    - Fixed rule code and eliminated assorted impediments.
    - Built testing code.
    - Moved Gene's Rule::Contour module into another distribution to contain
      rules - it'll be called POE::Framework::MIDI::Rules  (using the P:F:M:Rule 
      namespace).  This is a damn cool rule, but I decided it would keep things
      simpler if only a few simple example rules were included.  
      Same deal will go with transformations when they exist.
