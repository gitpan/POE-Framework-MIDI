TO DO

* Conductor needs to have a way to support chords containing notes
  of different lengths

This will probably get very nasty, since it involves rooting around 
in the guts of MIDI::Simple.  Not really a high priority, but it 
would be nice.

* Conductor needs phrase renderer support

* Add supported event type check to Conductor.pm during render

* Use Hook::LexWrap to install "Autorules" for Bars - effectively
  making themselves self-regulating

* Test, test, test!  t/* lacks.  :-\ 

* Noop support for twidding other MIDI params like modulation and
  pitch bend, etc.
  
  
* Bar object needs to develop intelligence to be able to enforce its 'rules'
( needs to match time sig, etc)

* shouldn't Phrase.pm be a subclass of Bar.pm ?
